# AI-Driven Decision Engine (Tic-Tac-Toe)

**Developer:** [Hanan Idris]  
**Technology Stack:** Python, Pygame, Artificial Intelligence (Minimax)

## 📌 Project Overview
Developed a game-based AI agent that demonstrates the power of computational logic and strategic decision-making. While the interface is a Tic-Tac-Toe game, the underlying engine is built to simulate thousands of future scenarios to determine the most optimal outcome.


* **Resource Optimization:** Calculating the best use of assets based on competing variables.
* **Predictive Analysis:** Anticipating "opponent" (market) moves to stay ahead.
* **Automated Decision Support:** Reducing human error in repetitive logic-based tasks.

## 🛠 Technical Features
* **Optimal AI Strategy:** Implemented the Minimax algorithm, ensuring the agent plays a perfect game.
* **Performance Optimization:** Integrated Alpha-Beta Pruning to reduce computation time, allowing for real-time decision-making without lag.
* **Clean Architecture:** Separated game logic (`tictactoe.py`) from the user interface (`runner.py`) for better scalability and maintenance.

## 💻 How to Use
1. Ensure Python 3 and Pygame are installed.
2. Launch the application via `python runner.py`.
3. Challenge the AI—it is designed to be unbeatable.
